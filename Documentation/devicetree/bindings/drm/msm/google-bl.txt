Google binned low power mode panel

This is an extension of QTI's mdss-dsi-panel to handle additional command
sequences for low power modes.

Required properties:
- compatible:           "google,dsi_binned_lp"

Google low power display modes

Required properties:
- compatible:		"google,lp-modes"
- label:			Name of the entry
- dsi-lp-brightness-threshold:
			Max brightness supported by the mode
- dsi-lp-command:	Command sequence to enter this mode
- dsi-lp-command-state:	Command state used in this mode

Example:

/ {
	...
	google,lp-modes {
		lp-mode@0 {
			label = "off";
			google,dsi-lp-brightness-threshold = <0>;
			google,dsi-lp-command = [
				05 01 00 00 00 00 01 22
			];
			google,dsi-lp-command-state = "dsi_lp_mode";
		};

		lp-mode@1 {
			label = "high";
			google,dsi-lp-brightness-threshold = <255>;
			google,dsi-lp-command = [
				39 01 00 00 00 00 03 51 01 FF
				05 01 00 00 00 00 01 12
			];
			google,dsi-lp-command-state = "dsi_lp_mode";
		};
};

Google high brightness display mode

This is an extension of QTI's mdss-dsi-panel to handle special display modes
that allow for exceptionally high brightness.

High brightness mode (HBM) is specified through 1 or more user brightness
ranges. Conceptually, Each HBM range contains,
1) User brightness threshold
2) Panel brightness range
3) DSI command (optional)

HBM ranges must be sorted by brightness threshold and not overlap.
An HBM range covers user brightness levels starting from the threshold, up to
but not including the next HBM mode's threshold.
The last HBM range covers user brightness levels starting from its threshold,
up to and including qcom,mdss-brightness-max-level.

When user brightness is updated, the appropriate HBM range is selected and the
corresponding DSI command, if present, is sent to the panel. Then the user's
brightness is linearly mapped to the panel's brightness range and the panel is
updated if needed.

Note that there is currently no support for backlight LUTs during HBM mode.

Required properties:
- google,hbm-ranges:	Parent list of HBM ranges.
- hbm-range@n:		An HBM range, starting at n=0.

Each hbm-range@n contains the following properties. Each property is required,
unless specified as optional:
- dsi-lp-brightness-threshold: Starting user brightness for this HBM range.
- dsi-hbm-range-entry-command: Optional command sequence to enter this mode.
- dsi-hbm-commands-state: Command state used in this mode.
- dsi-bl-hbm-min-level: Start of panel brightness range (inclusive).
- dsi-bl-hbm-max-level: End of panel brightness range (inclusive).

Example:

/ {
	...
	google,hbm-ranges {
		hbm-range@0 {
			google,dsi-hbm-brightness-threshold = <1>;

			google,dsi-bl-hbm-min-level = <0x5>;
			google,dsi-bl-hbm-max-level = <0x3ff>;
			google,dsi-hbm-range-entry-command = [
				15 01 00 00 00 00 02 53 20
			];
			google,dsi-hbm-commands-state = "dsi_lp_mode";
		};

		hbm-range@1 {
			google,dsi-hbm-brightness-threshold = <170>;

			google,dsi-bl-hbm-min-level = <0x3ff>;
			google,dsi-bl-hbm-max-level = <0x3ff>;
			google,dsi-hbm-range-entry-command = [
				15 01 00 00 00 00 02 53 E0
			];
			google,dsi-hbm-commands-state = "dsi_lp_mode";
		};
	};
